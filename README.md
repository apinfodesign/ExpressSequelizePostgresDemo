# ExpressSequelizePostgresDemo

Use sequelize to change your persistence layer on your single resource REST API from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. You can start from scratch or modify your existing codebase. Your API should support GET,POST,PUT and DELETE (PATCH is optional).

You should be able to use the same tests as you did for the MongoDB with minor modifications.

BONUS:

Implement PATCH 2pts
Implement Filter for GET 2pts

Data persistence: 12pts

Tests: 4pts

Structure, Organization, isolated change (data layer abstraction) as compared to mongo version: 4pts
